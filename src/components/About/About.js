        Watch Jon is In general, modern watches often display the day, date,
        month, and year. For mechanical watches, various extra features called
        "complications," such as moon-phase displays and the different types of
        tourbillon, are sometimes included. Most electronic quartz watches, on
        the other hand, include time-related features such as timers,
        chronographs and alarm functions. Furthermore, some modern watches (like
        smartwatches) even incorporate calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology
        or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use radio
        clock technology to regularly correct the time.

        Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements.
        However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate
        craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for simple
        timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, even though
        they are less accurate and more expensive than electronic ones
